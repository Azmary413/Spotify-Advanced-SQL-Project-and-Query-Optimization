## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## ðŸ›  Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

## 2. Table Creation


```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### 3. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

**Easy Queries:** Basic retrieval, filtering, and aggregation.
**Medium Queries:** Involves grouping, joins, and aggregation functions.
**Advanced Queries:** Uses nested subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2;

```

9. **For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.**

10. **Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        track,
        COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'YouTube' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_youtube,
        COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_spotify
    FROM spotify
    GROUP BY 1
) AS tl
WHERE streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
    AND 
	streamed_on_youtube <> 0;

```


### Advanced Level
11. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.

```sql
WITH ranking_artist AS
(
	SELECT 
	artist, 
	track, 
	SUM(views) AS total_views,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC ) AS rank
	FROM spotify
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 1,3 DESC
)
SELECT *
FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rank <= 3;

```

12. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.

```sql
SELECT 
artist,
track,
liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE liveness > (
	SELECT 
	AVG(liveness) AS avg_score
	FROM spotify
);

```

13. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**

```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
14. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.

```sql

SELECT
track,
ROUND(CAST(energy/liveness AS numeric), 2) AS energy_liveness_ratio

WHERE energy/liveness > 1.2
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

```

15. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.

```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	SUM(likes) OVER(ORDER BY views) AS cumulative_sum
FROM Spotify
	ORDER BY cumulative_sum DESC;
```

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **10.9 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **1.16 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:
      ![EXPLAIN Before Index](https://github.com/Azmary413/Spotify-Advanced-SQL-Project-and-Query-Optimization/blob/main/spotify_explain_before_index.jpg)

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.144 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **1.396 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:
      ![EXPLAIN After Index](https://github.com/Azmary413/Spotify-Advanced-SQL-Project-and-Query-Optimization/blob/main/spotify_explain_after_index.jpg)

- **Graphical Performance Comparison**
    - A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.
    - **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:

      ![Performance Graph](https://github.com/Azmary413/Spotify-Advanced-SQL-Project-and-Query-Optimization/blob/main/graphical_view_after_index.jpg)

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
